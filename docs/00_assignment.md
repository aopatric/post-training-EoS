# Assignment Overview

At a high level, the project tasks us with answering a research question related to the topics covered in the course and writing up the findings/insights in the form of a blog, *emphasizing communication*.

### Expectations

Project should:
- investigate a testable hypothesis
- present the resulting analysis in the format of a blog

Blog prose should be:
- technical
- of high quality
- not overly informal

This **each claim** made should be supported either by a citation, experiment, or a mathematical argument.

### Blog Length

The blog is expected to total around 2000-3000 Words and contain 4-6 figures/tables visualizing the aspects of the study. The word count does not include tables, figures, and appendices (which may not be read).

Project work should *not* be related to anything you've recieved credit for (or will recieve credit for) in another class/degree program.

### Grading + Submission

There is a *single* deliverable:
- **submit blog** (for 25\% of grade) by *December 09th, 11:59pm*

Grading rubric available [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eRBnvj4WVGOA-ikD4AxF0xRtNcmU98f6ZbF3P_C6Qho/edit). Projects mostly graded on novelty, soundness, clarity, lit review, and formatting.

### Formatting Details

Verbatim from the project guidelines:

Submission is on Gradescope. You should submit a single .zip file which includes an index.html. When we open index.html in a standard browser (Chrome), it should render the blog **without requiring an internet connection** (no dependencies on any files other than those in the .zip).

We provide a basic template you may use [here](https://web.mit.edu/phillipi/www/blog_template/index.html)
([zip file for this template](https://tinyurl.com/48x4zuay)). But you don’t have to use this. Feel free to get creative with the look and format of your blog.
